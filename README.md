This is a repo for my personal neovim config. You're welcome to borrow it if you like :)

Currently it uses:

- Tokyo Night colour scheme
- nvim-tree for file browser
- Treesitter for highlighting
- Telescope as file picker
- Mason/lspconfig for language server configs

Plus various little config tweaks to suit my tastes.
